This cheat sheet contains information about the 8086 microprocessor. Compared to standard textbooks, the main focus is conciseness, to-the-point descriptions, and readability. It is a direct result of scribe notes taken for the subject - Microprocessors (3+1 credits). Guess my grades? :)

Main topics included in the document are 8086 overviews, internal architecture, register organization, modes of operation, addressing modes, interrupts, memory, and assembly language programs (Instruction types, Memory segmentation, and Memory models). The program bank contains an excellent collection of ASM program questions. A question bank is also provided for examinations/quizzes.

You are more than welcome to use this! Let me know what are your suggestions or raise an issue. Found a typo or want to add something, raise a PR! All contributions are appreciated.
